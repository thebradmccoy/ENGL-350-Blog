# Bradley's About Me

![Bradley Mccoy](https://thebradmccoy.github.io/ENGL-350-Blog/images/IMG_4478.png)

I am currently working towards my 5th year pursuing a bachelors of science in Information Science with a focus on project management and client relations at CNU. 

It has taken me a bit longer than others but, after starting from next to no experience, I have managed to get this far purely based on a fascination with the rapid evolution of technology and how its changed how we do everything in our daily lives.

Following graduation, I have plans to start out working in the private sector for a defense contractor and eventually transitioning into the public domain once I find the field that I excel in.
