# Bradley's About Me

I am currently working towards my 5th year pursuing a bachelors of science in **Information Science** with a focus on project management and client relations at CNU. 

It has taken me a bit longer than others but, after starting from next to no experience, I have managed to get this far purely based on a fascination with the rapid evolution of technology and how its changed how we do everything in our daily lives.

**Following Graduation**, I have plans to start out working in the private sector for a defense contractor and eventually transitioning into the public domain once I find the field that I excel in and enjoy. I hope to one day find an occupation with a flexible work schedule and decent amount of travel whose work I can throw myself into. I don't know how far down the road that lies, but I make efforts everyday to develop myself into someone who deserves to structure their work around their life and not the other way around.

### Work
I grew up working carpentry contracts with my cousins, just as my cousins and my siblings did as well. I believe that it was meant to instill in us a proper sense of work ethic as well as a practical set of skills that we could make use of throughout our lives. Through my grandfather though, I learned not just those skills but also the importance of planning ahead and client relationships. 


Apart from carpentry, Ive had a multitude of jobs growing up ranging from selling christmas trees and fighting drunks as concert security to working as a temp for the county school system and most recently interning with Brightview Landscaping. 


Not what I consider work necessarily but over the past few years, I have also worked on some web development for organizations on campus. It is only an exploration of a useful skill, but it has worked out as a convenient favor to do for friends who needed a platform for their own passions.


At Brightview Landscaping, when I wasn't sent out to work with the crews, my degree was implemented to develop a program to organize one of their departments that had suffered due to disorganization in their tracking of contracts, orders, and inventory maintenance. When I could, the branch manager would have me sit in on their financials meetings and budget analysis comparisons due to my background in accounting and business administration courses.

### Interests / Hobbies
I wish I had more to say here but I have jumped around with hobbies throughout my life and lack a current hyperfixation. Throughout my life I have played sports year round, with swim in the summer, football and wrestling in the fall, and baseball/lacrosse in the spring. When I got to CNU, I played as a midfielder and Face-off for the CNU Club Lacrosse team and eventually competed on the D1 circuit for our Beach Volleyball team.  Currently, I am considering playing for the CNU Rugby team as I look for something new to throw myself into while I enjoy my final year at the University.

My hapy place is and always has been the shenandoah river property my cousins own where we dirtbike, swim, and skate now that we've built a full sized half-pipe in the barn! It has been passed down in their family and is treated as the personal playground where we are allowed to build whatever we like, putting those carpentry skill to use.
