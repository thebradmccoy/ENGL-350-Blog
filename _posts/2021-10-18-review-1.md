## **Summary**
<br />
The content explored in this project originates from the musical alchemical emblem book _Atalanta fugiens_ published by German alchemist and physician Michael Maier in the year 1618. Designed to "engage the ear, eye, and intellect, the work is comprised of a series of 50 emblems with their own accompanying "fugue" -musical scored for three voices, as well as a motto, a copperplate etching, an epigram in German and Latin. Historians in related fields have long hailed this work as a genius demonstration of alchemy's potential in literature and possible avenues to explore for the printed word.

## **Design**
<br />
Using transcriptions from the orginal book, the text is encoded in XML using TEI schema, including detailed notes within the repository regarding the conventions used, for posterity. This all allows more features to be repeatedly implemented than in a digital edition. The musical scores were created with Sibelius then exported to MEI, which preserves the representation of the various characteristics involved in physical musical documents. Javascript seems to be used in handling the majority of display and indexd tracking. The project features multiple custom-built functionalities in-house, like the image search, the zoom image viewer, as well as some libraries. The Greensock Animation API, along with some compatible plugins, and the Waypoints Javascript library handle ll the animatioon, menues, and maps within the project. In addition, the project includes three essays that cover history, culture, and art that inlfuenced the work in order to give audiences better context when exploring _Furnace and Fugue_.

## **Relevance**
<br />
"Atalanta fugiens lends itself unusually well to experimentation with digital tools." Implementing today's digital technology in order to re-render this composition that spans several media types, _Furnace and Fugue_ seeks to grant it's audience the opportunity to explore Maier's _Atalanta fugien_ in a way they believe he imagined. Interactive, flexible, and accessible; the project presents Maier's original masterpiece along with enhancements that allow the audience to engage deeoer into the books various elements regardless of their level of expertise.
